# Posting App C3P0

Container Application to consume and show information from [Hacker News API](https://hn.algolia.com). This Application is the  [Posting App R2D2](https://github.com/JesusIgnacio/posting-app-r2d2) view's.  You know what i mean ? C3P0 + R2D2 , unconditional friends from Stars Wars. you've a idea? no? How could be it possible? Maybe you're in the wrong place. 

## Stack
* [Angular](https://angular.io/)
* [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)
* [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Download and Installation

Let's get ready to rumble:
* clone this repository on your local machine.
* go to source folder.
* execute this commands on terminal:
  * ```docker build -t posting-c3p0:dev .``` // This command take a few minutes, so , go to write on google 'pacman' and have fun meantime :D.
  * ```docker run -p 4201:4200 -t posting-c3p0:dev```

So there is [Posting APP View](http://localhost:4201) ...i hope so :). 

And remember if you don't have R2D2 running, you don't see any row in the list.
If you have any questions, let me know.
